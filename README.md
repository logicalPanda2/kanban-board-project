## Future Plans
Some backstory: this project was made because I lost a bet. It was made in only two days! <br>
In the end, it turned out quite nice, so I made it a proper repository. <br>
As of now, several features are still being actively developed:
1. Responsiveness, mobile-first
2. Dark mode
3. Welcome screen
4. Routing integration and other code quality improvements
5. Other QoL improvements, such as: change task status with keyboard, `CLEAR ALL` button, details input improvement, tag visual indicator on modal etc.

Expect these features in the very near future.
